## Tutorial

### Download data

1) Install `gdown` to download from Google Drive

    pip install gdown


2) Download all 5 data archives 

    # This does not work because of the share link permissions! 
    sh download_data.sh


### Setup Python environment 

1) [Install Anaconda using their documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/linux/)


2) Create Anaconda environment from requirements file
<!-- end of the list -->

    conda env create --file environment.yml


3) Activate Anaconda environment
<!-- end of the list -->

    conda activate wlai


4) Deactive Anaconda environment (when you are finished working)
<!-- end of the list -->

    conda deactivate


### Run model on PC workstation

1) Run simple example (single station with minimal options)

- `qc_model_nn.py` contains neural network architecture and related utilities.
- It also has a `main` function that demonstrates how to use the functions to train a model.
<!-- end of the list -->

    python qc_model_nn.py \ 
        --station 9751639 \
        --directory data/ \
        --epochs 5        \
        --batch_size 256


### Run model on Slurm-based HPC
